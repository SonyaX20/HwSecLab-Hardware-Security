"""
Use scope_api.py in combination with modular_exponentiation_api.py to record and extract power traces automatically:
	1. Keep the configuration (vertical, horizontal and trigger setup) from the previous subtask
	2. Arm the scope (scope_api.py)
	3. Request MODEXP (modular_exponentiation_api.py)
	4. Wait until the scope gets triggered (scope_api.py)
	5. Download the power trace (i.e. the samples) presented on the scope screen (scope_api.py)
	6. Store the power trace
